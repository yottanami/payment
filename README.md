**payment** is a sample Ruby application used to manage products, discounts and promotions.

* Works fine with `Ruby 2.4.1` and other versions are not tested yet.

# Usage

* Run `bundle install` to setup necessary GEMs.

* Run IRB with `rake console` for interactive console.

Create a shopping cart first:

```ruby
cart = Payment::Cart.new
```

Create some products for testing:

```ruby
product1 = Payment::Product.new('001', 'Lavender heart', 9.25)
product2 = Payment::Product.new('002', 'Personalised cufflinks', 45.00)
product3 = Payment::Product.new('003', 'Kids T-shirt', 19.95)
```

Create a new promotion! Below there is an example for product with 001 code. If a user adds more than 2 products with 001 code, a reduction of 0.75 applies to each product.

```ruby
promotion = Payment::Promotion.new('001', 0.75)
```

Add products to the cart:

```ruby
cart.add product1
cart.add product2
cart.add product1
cart.add product3
```

Apply promotion to the cart:

```ruby
cart.add_promotion promotion
```

Check total price (net):

```ruby
cart.total_net # 73.76£
```

Check total price (gross):

```ruby
cart.total_gross # 83.45£
```

Keep promotion rule, but do not apply it to the current cart:

```ruby
cart.remove_promotion promotion
cart.total_net # 75.11£
```

## Tests and Status

Currently, all tests are passing with awesome 'green'. Run `bundle exec rspec` for tests and `rubocop` for code quality.

Code quality is checked with [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop), [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/).
